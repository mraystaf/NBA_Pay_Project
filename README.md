# NBA_Pay_Project

# Here is a project that I put together for fun! I wanted to see which players in the National Basketball Association (NBA) are the most valuable to their teams, compared with how much they are paid. 
# I took player stats from the 2022-23 season (so far) and created an index for the value of each player, based on their stats. I linked this data with salary data and ran a regression. 
# I created a graph that shows a positive correlation between a player's salary and their value (no surprise their). 
# I also used this data to see which players are the most valuable, and which players are the most overpaid (meaning they don't contribute what their salary is worth).
# Disclaimer: I am an NBA fan, but not an expert. The index I created for value may be suboptimal. I am open for recommendations on how to change my value metric.
